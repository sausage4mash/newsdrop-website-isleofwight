The decision came after a lengthy debate in the council chambers, where local representatives weighed the benefits of new development against concerns about infrastructure and environmental impact.</p><p>The approved plan includes the construction of over 400 new homes across several key sites, with a significant portion allocated for affordable and social housing. Council leader Jane Smith described the move as “a necessary step forward” to ensure young families and key workers can continue to live and thrive on the island.</p>"
